# Fluid Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simple fluid simulation implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It provides a basic visualization of fluid dynamics, including velocity vectors and pressure.

## Features

- Fluid simulation using a grid-based approach
- Visualization of pressure, velocity, and smoke (density)
- Interactivity: Users can introduce obstacles to the fluid flow by clicking and dragging on the canvas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fluid-simulation.git
   cd fluid-simulation

2. Open the **index.html** file in your preferred web browser.

## Configuration

Adjust simulation parameters in the JavaScript code as needed:

1. **`numX`** and **`numY`**: Number of grid cells in the X and Y directions.
2. **`h`**: Grid spacing.
3. Other parameters related to fluid properties.

### Usage
1.Click and drag on the canvas to introduce obstacles to the **`fluid flow`**.
2.Observe the simulation of fluid dynamics, including `pressure`, `velocity`, and `smoke`.
